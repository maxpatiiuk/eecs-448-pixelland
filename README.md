## Welcome to Pixelland:

Available Maps:

### Rainbowland

![](documentation/screenshots/rainbowland.png)

You are spawned in a middle of a blocky gradient with seemingly no task at hand
other than to wander around and ponder the mysteries of the universe.

### Minecraft

![](documentation/screenshots/mc.png)


This sure feels like a Minecraft clone. Except, it has no mines or carts - just
2d sprites procedurally generated in every direction as far as eye can see.

Has a functional inventory system as well as item placing.

## Deployment and Documentation

See the docs in the [documentation directory](./documentation/)
